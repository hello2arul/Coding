2. Preorder -> root, left, right
3. Postorder -> left, right, root

a binary tree can be constructed fromn
1. inorder & preorder
2. indoer & postorder

Complete binary tree:
    Completely filled except maybe the last level and the last level should be filled from left to right.

Self balancing trees:
1. AVL tree
   -> has difference between height of left and right subtrees at most 1
