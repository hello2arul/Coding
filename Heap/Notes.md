A Heap is a Tree-based data structure, which satisfies the below properties:
* A Heap is a complete tree (All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible).

* A Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap. In a Min-Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in the Binary Heap. The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in the Tree. Max Heap is similar to MinHeap.
