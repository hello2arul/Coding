 * https://leetcode.com/problems/my-calendar-i/
 * You are implementing a program to use as your calendar. We can add a new event if adding the event will not cause a double booking.

A double booking happens when two events have some non-empty intersection (i.e., some moment is common to both events.).

The event can be represented as a pair of integers start and end that represents a booking on the half-open interval [start, end), 
the range of real numbers x such that start <= x < end.

Implement the MyCalendar class:

MyCalendar() Initializes the calendar object.
boolean book(int start, int end) Returns true if the event can be added to the calendar successfully without causing a double booking.
 Otherwise, return false and do not add the event to the calendar.
